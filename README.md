Project submitted and demoed at [HackWITus2](https://devpost.com/software/wizcraft)

## Inspiration

Our main inspiration behind this project was to integrate the Myo armband with Unity and learn more about the AI. We made a 3D competitive game using Unity and Myo armband.

## What it does

Compete against the bot using different gestures to cast spells and attack!

## How We built it

This was built using the Unity Game Engine in which the scripts were written in C#. The Myo armband was integrated with the game to give gesture controlled inputs to the game.

## Challenges We ran into

Programming the AI bot was the main challenge we ran into.

## Accomplishments that We're proud of

Making an interesting gesture controlled game.

## What We learned

Programming the AI to compete against users, successfully integrating the game with Myo armband.

## What's next for WizCraft

More interactive UI and allow multiple players to compete against each other through a centralized server.

## Built With

Unity, Myo Armband, C#
